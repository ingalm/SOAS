# To run this project

## Prerequisites

- Python (ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed)
- Poetry (a dependency manager for Python projects)

# Running the project

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. poetry install

Depending on what part you want to run:

Visualization of the project: poetry run python visualization.py
Running simulations to find averages: poetry run python UDD.py
- I recommend lowering the amount of simulations for a faster completion of the program, though keep in mind the averages are affected by this
Developing plots after simulations are done: poetry run python plot.py
